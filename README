Basecamp Interface -- Built with Codeigniter, Wiredesignz HMVC, Phil Sturgeon's Template library for CI

This is a really basic iframe-based Basecamp time report scraper that I whipped up because "Show me 
just my hours from today" is a five-click operation for some reason in the regular Basecamp 
interface.

Why build this in Codeigniter rather than just writing a one-file page? I don't have a good answer for 
that. --Jacob Sewell
